# BrainBlocks: A Multi-Modal Tetris Game â€” Consumer Version

## Description

2-D Unity game that with two control schemes: 
- Brain Computer Interface (BCI) control using facial expression detection and trained mental command classification with the Emotiv EPOC (https://www.emotiv.com/epoc/)
- Traditional control using keyboard inputs

An overview of the control schemes can be found at \Documents\controls.pdf

These are the files of the consumer version of BrainBlocks. BrainBlocks was originally created to be used in an experiment on user experience, the files of which can be found [here](https://github.com/esposen/BrainBlocks). The consumer version allows for more training of BCI commands and doesn't hold users to the strict training and playing procedures of the experiment.
